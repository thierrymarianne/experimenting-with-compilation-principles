and\nsimple as a JavaScript object).\n        \nI had the following requirements in mind:\n - Drawing visual representations\n - Such representation should be reactive\n\nI came up with the following prototype, \nwhich would work with very simple examples, like\n\n<source-code \n  wrap\n  color='clickable' \n  v-on:click.native='copyToInputArea($event)'>{{ getDefaultJsonExample }}</source-code><br />\n<source-code\n  color='clickable'\n  v-on:click.native='copyToInputArea($event)'>{ margin-left: 10px }</source-code>\n<source-code \n  color='clickable'\n  v-on:click.native='copyToInputArea($event)'>{ color: blue }</source-code>\n\nProvided the replacement of substrings\nusing regular expressions\nto fix half-compliant JSON\nwould not help much to deal with \nthe task at hand, I've decided to dive into \n<browsable-link href='https://bit.ly/compilers-principles'>Compilers - Principles, Techniques, & Tools</browsable-link>\nin order to exercice

Parallelism can be found at several levels: at the instruction level, where multiple operations are executed simultaneously and at the processor level, where different threads of the same application are run on different processors. Memory hierarchies are a response to the basic limitation that we can build very fast storage or very large storage, but not storage that is both fast and large.\n      <h3>Parallelism</h3>\nAll modern microprocessors exploit instruction-level parallelism. However, this parallelism can be hidden fron the programmer. Programs are written as if all instructions were executed in sequence; the hardware dynamically checks for dependencies in the sequential instruction stream and issues them in parallel when possible. In some cases, the machine includes a hardware scheduler that can change the instruction ordering to increase the parallelism in the program. Whether the hardware reorders the instructions or not, compilers can rearrange the instructions to make instruction-level parallelism more effective.\n<br />\nInstruction-level parallelism can also appear explicitly in the instruction set. VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) machines have instructions that can issue multiple operations in parallel. The Intel IA64 is a well-known example of such an architecture. All high-performance, general-purpose microprocessors also include instructions that can operate on a vector of data at the same time. Compiler techniques have been developed to generate code automatically for such machines from sequential programs.\n      <h3>Memory hierarchies</h3>\nA memory hierarchy consists of several levels of storage with different speeds\nand sizes, with the level closest to the processor being the fastest\nbut smallest. The average memory-access time of a program is reduced if\nmost of its accesses are satisfied by the faster levels of the hierarchy.\nBoth parallelism and the existence of a memory hierarchy improve the potential\nperformance of a machine, but they must be harnessed effectively by the compiler to deliver real performance on an application.\n<br />\nMemory hierarchies are found in all machines.\nA processor usually has a small number of registers consisting of hundreds of bytes, several levels of caches containing kilobytes to megabytes, physical memory containing megabytes to gigabytes,\nand finally secondary storage that contains gigabytes and beyond. Correspondingly, the speed of accesses between adjacent levels of the hierarchy can differ by two or three orders of magnitude. The performance of a system is often limited not by the speed of the processor but by the performance of the memory subsystem. While compilers traditionally focus on optimizing the processor execution, more emphasis is now placed on making the memory hierarchy more effective.\n\nUsing registers effectively is probably the single most important problem in optimizing a program. Unlike registers that have to be managed explicitly in software, caches and physical memories are hidden from the instruction set and are managed by hardware. It has been found that cache-management policies implemented by hardware are not effective in some cases, especially in scientific code that has large data structure  (arrays, typically).

Hardware designs are typically described at    \nthe register transfer level (RTL), where variables represent registers and expressions represent combinational logic. Hardware-synthesis tools translate RTL descriptions automatically into gates, which arre then  mapped  to transistors and eventually to a physical layout.

For example, query languages, especially SQL (Structured Query Language), are used to search databases. Database queries consist of predicates containing relational and boolean operators. They can be\ninterpreted or compiled into commands to search a database for records satisfying that predicate.\n<h3>Compiled Simulation</h3>\nSimulation is a general technique used in many scientific and engineering disciplines to understand a phenomenon or to validate a design. Inputs to a simulator usually include the description of the design and specific input parameters for that particular simulation run. Simulations can be very expensive. We typically need to simulate many possible design alternatives on many different input sets, and each experiment may take days to complete on a high-performance machine. Instead of writing a simulator that interprets the design, it is faster to compile the design to produce machine code that simulates that particular design natively. Compiled simulation can run orders of magnitude faster than an interpreter-based approach.

Of special importance are techniques that detect statically when a program might have a security vulnerability.\n<h3>Type Checking</h3>\nType checking is an effective and well-established technique to catch inconsistencies in programs. It can be used to catch errors, for example, where an operation is applied to the wrong type of object, or if parameters passed to a procedure do not match the signature of the procedure. Program analysis can go beyond finding type errors by analyzing the flow of data through a program. For example, if a pointer is assigned null and then immediately dereferenced. the program is clearly in error.\nThe same technology can be used to catch a variety of security holes, in which an attacker supplies a string or other data that is used carelessly by the program. A user-supplied string can be labeled with a type \"dangerous.\" If\nthis string is not checked for proper format, then it remains \"dangerous\", and if a string of this type is able to influence the control-flow of the     \ncode at some point in the program, then there is a potential security flaw.\n<h3>Bounds Checking<</h3>\nIt is easier to make mistakes when programming in a lower-level language than a higher-level one. For example, many security breaches in systems are caused by buffer overflows in programs written in C. Because C does not have array bounds checks, it is up to the user to ensure that the arrays are not accessed out of bounds. Failing to check that the data supplied by the user can overflow a buffer, the program may be tricked into storing user data outside of the buffer. An attacker can manipulate the input data that causes the program to misbehave and compromise the security of the system. Techniques have been developed to find buffer overflows in programs, but with limited success.\n<br />Had the program been written in a safe language that includes automatic range checking, this problem would not have occurred. The same data-flow analysis  that  is used  to  eliminate  redundant  range  checks  can  also  be used to locate buffer overflows. The major difference, however, is that failing to elimate a range check would only result in a small run-time cost, while failing to identify a potential buffer overflow may compromise the  security of the system. Thus, while it is adequate to use simple techniques to optimize range checks, sophisticated analyses, such as tracking the  values of pointers across procedures, are needed to get high-quality results in error detection tools.\n<h3>Memory-Management Tools</h3>\nGarbage collection is another excellent example of the tradeoff between efficiency and a combination of ease of programming and software reliability. Automatic memory management obliterates all memory-management errors (e.g., \"memory leaks\"), which are a major source of problems in C and C++ programs. Various tools have been developed to help programmers find memory management errors. For example, Purify is a widely used tool that dynamically catches memory management errors as they occur.
