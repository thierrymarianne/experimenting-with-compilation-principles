It is more complex because\nprocessor architecture have become more complex, yielding more opportunies\nto improve the way code executes.

Generally, higher-level programming languages are easier to program in, but are less efficient, that is, the target programs run more slowly. Programmers using a low-level language have more control over a computation   and can, in principle, produce more efficient code. Unfortunately, lower-level programs are harder to write and - worse still - less portable, more prone to errors, and harder to maintain. Optimizing compilers include techniques to improve the performance of generated code, thus offsetting the  inefficiency introduced by high-level abstractions.\n<br />\nThe many shifts in the popular choice of programming languages have been in the direction of increased levels of abstraction. C was the predominant systems programming language of the 80's; many of the new projects started in the 90's chose C++; Java, introduced in 1995, gained popularity quickly in the late 90's.

The fact that error detectors may be unsound makes them significantly different from compiler optimizations. Optimizers must be conservative and cannot alter the semantics of the program under any circumstances.\n<br />\nIn the balance of this section, we shall mention several ways in which program analysis, building upon techniques originally developed to optimize code in compilers, have improved software productivity. Of special importance are techniques that detect statically when a program might have a security vulnerability.\n<h3>Type Checking</h3>\nType checking is an effective and well-established technique to catch inconsistencies in programs. It can be used to catch errors, for example, where an operation is applied to the wrong type of object, or if parameters passed to a procedure do not match the signature of the procedure. Program analysis can go beyond finding type errors by analyzing the flow of data through a program. For example, if a pointer is assigned null and then immediately dereferenced. the program is clearly in error.\nThe same technology can be used to catch a variety of security holes, in which an attacker supplies a string or other data that is used carelessly by the program. A user-supplied string can be labeled with a type \"dangerous.\" If\nthis string is not checked for proper format, then it remains \"dangerous\", and if a string of this type is able to influence the control-flow of the     \ncode at some point in the program, then there is a potential security flaw.\n<h3>Bounds Checking<</h3>\nIt is easier to make mistakes when programming in a lower-level language than a higher-level one. For example, many security breaches in systems are caused by buffer overflows in programs written in C. Because C does not have array bounds checks, it is up to the user to ensure that the arrays are not accessed out of bounds. Failing to check that the data supplied by the user can overflow a buffer, the program may be tricked into storing user data outside of the buffer. An attacker can manipulate the input data that causes the program to misbehave and compromise the security of the system. Techniques have been developed to find buffer overflows in programs, but with limited success.\n<br />Had the program been written in a safe language that includes automatic range checking, this problem would not have occurred. The same data-flow analysis  that  is used  to  eliminate  redundant  range  checks  can  also  be used to locate buffer overflows. The major difference, however, is that failing to elimate a range check would only result in a small run-time cost, while failing to identify a potential buffer overflow may compromise the  security of the system. Thus, while it is adequate to use simple techniques to optimize range checks, sophisticated analyses, such as tracking the  values of pointers across procedures, are needed to get high-quality results in error detection tools.\n<h3>Memory-Management Tools</h3>\nGarbage collection is another excellent example of the tradeoff between efficiency and a combination of ease of programming and software reliability. Automatic memory management obliterates all memory-management errors (e.g., \"memory leaks\"), which are a major source of problems in C and C++ programs. Various tools have been developed to help programmers find memory management errors. For example, Purify is a widely used tool that dynamically catches memory management errors as they occur. Tools that help identify some of these problems statically have also been developed.</multimedia-content>\n  </div>\n</template>\n  \n<script>\nimport MultimediaContent from '../multimedia-content.vue';\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'software-productivity-tools',\n  components: {\n    'multimedia-content': MultimediaContent\n  },\n}\n</script>\n","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./software-productivity-tools.vue?vue&type=template&id=570f5f60&\"\nimport script from \"./software-productivity-tools.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./software-productivity-tools.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"content\"},[_c('multimedia-content',[_vm._v(\"Programs are arguably the most complicated\\nengineering artifacts ever produced; they consist of many many details, every one of which must be correct before the program will work completely.

A user-supplied string can be labeled with a type \\\"dangerous.\\\" If\\nthis string is not checked for proper format, then it remains \\\"dangerous\\\", and if a string of this type is able to influence the control-flow of the     \\ncode at some point in the program, then there is a potential security flaw.\\n\"),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"Bounds Checking<\")]),_vm._v(\"\\nIt is easier to make mistakes when programming in a lower-level language than a higher-level one. For example, many security breaches in systems are caused by buffer overflows in programs written in C. Because C does not have array bounds checks, it is up to the user to ensure that the arrays are not accessed out of bounds. Failing to check that the data supplied by the user can overflow a buffer, the program may be tricked into storing user data outside of the buffer. An attacker can manipulate the input data that causes the program to misbehave and compromise the security of the system. Techniques have been developed to find buffer overflows in programs, but with limited success.\\n\"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"Had the program been written in a safe language that includes automatic range checking, this problem would not have occurred. The same data-flow analysis  that  is used  to  eliminate  redundant  range  checks  can  also  be used to locate buffer overflows. The major difference, however, is that failing to elimate a range check would only result in a small run-time cost, while failing to identify a potential buffer overflow may compromise the  security of the system. Thus, while it is adequate to use simple techniques to optimize range checks, sophisticated analyses, such as tracking the  values of pointers across procedures, are needed to get high-quality results in error detection tools.\\n\"),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"Memory-Management Tools\")]),_vm._v(\"\\nGarbage collection is another excellent example of the tradeoff between efficiency and a combination of ease of programming and software reliability. Automatic memory management obliterates all memory-management errors (e.g., \\\"memory leaks\\\"), which are a major source of problems in C and C++ programs. Various tools have been developed to help programmers find memory management errors. For example, Purify is a widely used tool that dynamically catches memory management errors as they occur. Tools that help identify some of these problems statically have also been developed.\")])],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??ref--2!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./expr.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
