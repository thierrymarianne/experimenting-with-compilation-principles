intermediate representation \nshould have two important properties:\n - it should be easy to produce and\n - it should be easy to translate into the target machine.\n\nFor instance, one can consider an intermediate form called \n<em>three-address code</em>, which consists of a sequence of \nassembly-like instructions with\nthree operands per instruction.\nEach operand can act like a register. \n\nThere are several points worth nothing about\nthree-address instructions.\nFirst, each three-adress assignment instructions \nhas at most one operator on the right side.\nThus, these instructions

It is more complex because\nprocessor architecture have become more complex, yielding more opportunies\nto improve the way code executes. It is more important because massively\nparallel computers require substantial optimization, or their performance\nsuffers by orders of magnitude. With the likely prevalence of multicore machines\n(computers with chips that have large numbers of processors on them),\nall compilers will have to face the problem of\ntaking advantage of multiprocessor machines. \n<br />\nIt is hard, if not impossible, to build a robust compiler out of \"hacks\".\nThus, an extensive and useful theory has been built up\naround the problem of optimizing code.\nThe use of a rigorous mathematical foundation allows us to show\nthat an optimization is correct and that it produces the desirable effect\nfor all possible inputs. \n<br />\nOn the other hand, pure theory alone is insufficient.\nLike many real-world problems, there are no perfect answers.\nIn fact, most of the questions that we ask in compiler optimization\nare undecidable. One of the most important skills in compiler design\nis the ability to formulate the right problem to solve.\n<br />\nWe need a good understanding of the behavior of programs to start\nwith and thorough experimentation and evaluation to validate our intuitions.\n<br />\nCompiler optimizations must meet the following design objectives:\n<ul>\n  <li>The optimization must be correct, that is,\npreserve the meaning of the compiled program,</li>\n  <li>The optimization must improve the performance of many programs</li>\n  <li>The compilation time must be kept reasonable, and</li>\n  <li>The engineering effort required must be manageable.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is impossible to overemphasize the importance of correctness.\nIt is trivial to write a compiler that generates fast code\nif the generated code need not be correct!\nOptimizing compilers are so difficult to get right that we dare say\nthat no optimizing compiler is completely error-free! \nThus, the most important objective in writing a compiler is that it is correct. \n<br />\nThe second goal is that the compiler must be effective in improving\nthe performance of many input programs.\nNormally, performance means speed of the program execution.\nEspecially in embedded applications, we may also wish to minimize\nthe size of the generated code.\n<br />\nAnd in the case of mobile devices, it is also desirable that\nthe code minimizes power consumption. Typically, the same optimizations\nthat speed up execution time also conserve power.\n<br />\nBesides performance, usability aspects such as error reporting\nand debugging are also important.\n<br />\nThird, we meed to keep the compilation time short to support a rapid\ndevelopment and debugging cycle.

Generally, higher-level programming languages are easier to program in, but are less efficient, that is, the target programs run more slowly. Programmers using a low-level language have more control over a computation   and can, in principle, produce more efficient code. Unfortunately, lower-level programs are harder to write and - worse still - less portable, more prone to errors, and harder to maintain. Optimizing compilers include techniques to improve the performance of generated code, thus offsetting the  inefficiency introduced by high-level abstractions.\n<br />\nThe many shifts in the popular choice of programming languages have been in the direction of increased levels of abstraction. C was the predominant systems programming language of the 80's; many of the new projects started in the 90's chose C++; Java, introduced in 1995, gained popularity quickly in the late 90's. The new programming-language features introduced in each round spurred new research in compiler optimization.\n<br />\nPractically all common programming languages , including C, Fortran and Cobol, support user-defined aggregate data types, such as arrays and structures, and high-level control flow, such as loops and procedure invocations. If we just take each high-level construct or data-access operation and translate it directly to machine code, the result would be very inefficient. A body of compiler optimizations, known as <em>data-flow optimizations</em>, has been developed to analyze the flow of data through the program and removes redundancies across these constructs. They are effective in generating code that resembles code written by a skilled programmer at a lower level.\n<br />Object orientation was first introduced in Simula in 1967, and has been incorporated in languages such as Smallt alk , C+ + , C# , and Java. The key ideas behind object orientation are\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Data abstraction and</li>\n  <li>Inheritance of properties,</li>\n</ol>\n\nboth of which have been found to make programs more modular and easier to maintain. Object-oriented programs are different from those written in many other languages, in that they consist of many more, but smaller, procedures (called methods in object-oriented terms). Thus, compiler optimizations must be able to perform well across the procedural boundaries of the source program. Procedure inlining , which is the replacement of a procedure call by the body of the procedure, is particularly useful here. Optimizations to speed up virtual method dispatches have also been developed.\n<br />\nJava has many features that make programming easier, many of which have been introduced previously in other languages. The Java language is type-safe; that is, an object cannot be used as an object of an unrelated type. All array accesses are checked to ensure that they lie within the bounds of the array. Java has no pointers and does not allow pointer arithmetic. It has a built-in garbage-collection facility that automatically frees the memory of variables that are no longer in use. While all these features make programming easier, they incur a run-time overhead. Compiler optimizations have been developed to reduce the overhead, for example, by eliminating unnecessary range checks and by allocating objects that are not accessible beyond a procedure on the stack instead of the heap. Effective algorithms also have been developed to minimize the overhead of garbage collection.\n<br />\nIn addition, Java is designed to support portable and mobile code. Programs are distributed as Java byteecode, which must either be interpreted or compiled into native code dynamically, that is, at runtime.

It can be used to catch errors, for example, where an operation is applied to the wrong type of object, or if parameters passed to a procedure do not match the signature of the procedure. Program analysis can go beyond finding type errors by analyzing the flow of data through a program. For example, if a pointer is assigned null and then immediately dereferenced. the program is clearly in error.\nThe same technology can be used to catch a variety of security holes, in which an attacker supplies a string or other data that is used carelessly by the program. A user-supplied string can be labeled with a type \"dangerous.\" If\nthis string is not checked for proper format, then it remains \"dangerous\", and if a string of this type is able to influence the control-flow of the     \ncode at some point in the program, then there is a potential security flaw.\n<h3>Bounds Checking<</h3>\nIt is easier to make mistakes when programming in a lower-level language than a higher-level one. For example, many security breaches in systems are caused by buffer overflows in programs written in C. Because C does not have array bounds checks, it is up to the user to ensure that the arrays are not accessed out of bounds. Failing to check that the data supplied by the user can overflow a buffer, the program may be tricked into storing user data outside of the buffer. An attacker can manipulate the input data that causes the program to misbehave and compromise the security of the system. Techniques have been developed to find buffer overflows in programs, but with limited success.\n<br />Had the program been written in a safe language that includes automatic range checking, this problem would not have occurred. The same data-flow analysis  that  is used  to  eliminate  redundant  range  checks  can  also  be used to locate buffer overflows. The major difference, however, is that failing to elimate a range check would only result in a small run-time cost, while failing to identify a potential buffer overflow may compromise the  security of the system. Thus, while it is adequate to use simple techniques to optimize range checks, sophisticated analyses, such as tracking the  values of pointers across procedures, are needed to get high-quality results in error detection tools.\n<h3>Memory-Management Tools</h3>\nGarbage collection is another excellent example of the tradeoff between efficiency and a combination of ease of programming and software reliability. Automatic memory management obliterates all memory-management errors (e.g., \"memory leaks\"), which are a major source of problems in C and C++ programs.
