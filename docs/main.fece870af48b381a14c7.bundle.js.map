Initially, the instructions in an assembly language were just mnemonic representations of machine instructions.\n<br />\nLater, macro instructions were added to assembly languages so that a programmer could define parameterized shorthands for frequently used sequences of machine instructions.\n<br />\nA major step towards higher-level languages was made in the latter half of the 1950's with the development of Fortran for scientific computation, Cobol for business data processing, and Lisp for symbolic computation. The philosophy behind these languages was to create higher-level notations with which programmers could more easily write numerical computations, business applications, and symbolic programs. These languages were so successful that they are still in use today.\n<br />\nIn the following decades, many more languages were created with innovative features to help make programming easier, more natural, and more robust. Later in this chapter, we shall discuss some key features that are common to many modern programming languages.\n<br />\nToday, there are thousands of programming languages. They can be classified in a variety of ways. \nOne classification is by generation. <em>First-generation</em> languages are the machine languages, <em>second-generation</em> the assembly languages, and <em>third-generation</em> the higher-level languages like Fortran, Cobol, Lisp,  C, C++,  C#, and  Java. <em>Fourth-generation</em> languages are languages designed for specific applications like NOMAD for report generation, SQL for database queries, and Postscript for text formatting. The term <em>fifth-generation</em> language has been applied to logic- and constraint-based languages like Prolog and OPS5.\n<br />\nAnother classification of languages uses the term <em>imperative</em> for languages in which a program specifies <em>how</em> a computation is to be done and <em>declarative</em> for languages in which a program specifies <em>what</em> computation is to be done. Languages such as C, C++, C#, and Java are imperative languages. In imperative languages there is a notion of program state and statements that change the state. Functional languages such as ML and Haskell and constraint logic languages such as Prolog are often considered to be declarative languages .\n<br />\nThe term <em>von Neumann language</em> is applied to programming languages whose cornputational model is based on the von Neumann computer architecture. Many of today's languages, such as Fortran and C are von Neumann languages.\n<br />\nAn object-oriented language is one that supports object-oriented programming, a programming style in which a program consists of a collection of objects that interact with one another. Simula 67 and Smalltalk are the earliest major object-oriented languages. Languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Ruby are more recent object-oriented languages.\n<br />\n<em>Scripting languages</em> are interpreted languages with high-level operators designed for \"gluing together\" computations.

The performance of a system is often limited not by the speed of the processor but by the performance of the memory subsystem.

The following applications of program-translation techniques.\n<h3>Binary Translation</h3>\nCompiler technology can be used to translate the binary code for one machine\nto that of another, allowing a machine to run programs originally compiled for another instruction set. Binary translation technology has been used by various computer companies to increase the availability of software for their machines. In particular, because of the domination of the x86 personal-computer market, most software titles are available as x86 code.    \nBinary translators have been developed to convert x86 code into both Alpha and Spare code. Binary translation was also used by Transmeta Inc. in their implementation of the x86 instruction set. Instead of executing the complex x86 instruction set directly in hardware, the Transmeta Crusoe processor is a VLIW processor that relies on binary translation to convert x86 code into native VLIW code.\n<br />\nBinary translation can also be used to provide backward compatibility. When the processor in the Apple Macintosh was changed frorn the Motorola MC 68040 to the PowerPC in 1994, binary translation was used to allow PowerPC processors run legacy MC 68040 code.\n<h3>Hardware Synthesis</h3>\nNot only is most software written in high-level languages; even hardware designs are mostly described in high-level hardware description languages like Verilog and VHDL (Very high-speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language). Hardware designs are typically described at    \nthe register transfer level (RTL), where variables represent registers and expressions represent combinational logic. Hardware-synthesis tools translate RTL descriptions automatically into gates, which arre then  mapped  to transistors and eventually to a physical layout. Unlike compilers or programming languages these tools often take hours optimizing the circuit. Techniques to translate designs at higher levels, such as the behavior or functional level, also exist.\n<h3>Database Query Interpreters</h3>\nBesides specifying software and hardware, languages are useful in many other\napplications. For example, query languages, especially SQL (Structured Query Language), are used to search databases. Database queries consist of predicates containing relational and boolean operators. They can be\ninterpreted or compiled into commands to search a database for records satisfying that predicate.\n<h3>Compiled Simulation</h3>\nSimulation is a general technique used in many scientific and engineering disciplines to understand a phenomenon or to validate a design. Inputs to a simulator usually include the description of the design and specific input parameters for that particular simulation run. Simulations can be very expensive. We typically need to simulate many possible design alternatives on many different input sets, and each experiment may take days to complete on a high-performance machine. Instead of writing a simulator that interprets the design, it is faster to compile the design to produce machine code that simulates that particular design natively. Compiled simulation can run orders of magnitude faster than an interpreter-based approach.

Of special importance are techniques that detect statically when a program might have a security vulnerability.\n<h3>Type Checking</h3>\nType checking is an effective and well-established technique to catch inconsistencies in programs. It can be used to catch errors, for example, where an operation is applied to the wrong type of object, or if parameters passed to a procedure do not match the signature of the procedure. Program analysis can go beyond finding type errors by analyzing the flow of data through a program. For example, if a pointer is assigned null and then immediately dereferenced. the program is clearly in error.\nThe same technology can be used to catch a variety of security holes, in which an attacker supplies a string or other data that is used carelessly by the program. A user-supplied string can be labeled with a type \"dangerous.\" If\nthis string is not checked for proper format, then it remains \"dangerous\", and if a string of this type is able to influence the control-flow of the     \ncode at some point in the program, then there is a potential security flaw.\n<h3>Bounds Checking<</h3>\nIt is easier to make mistakes when programming in a lower-level language than a higher-level one. For example, many security breaches in systems are caused by buffer overflows in programs written in C. Because C does not have array bounds checks, it is up to the user to ensure that the arrays are not accessed out of bounds. Failing to check that the data supplied by the user can overflow a buffer, the program may be tricked into storing user data outside of the buffer. An attacker can manipulate the input data that causes the program to misbehave and compromise the security of the system. Techniques have been developed to find buffer overflows in programs, but with limited success.\n<br />Had the program been written in a safe language that includes automatic range checking, this problem would not have occurred. The same data-flow analysis  that  is used  to  eliminate  redundant  range  checks  can  also  be used to locate buffer overflows. The major difference, however, is that failing to elimate a range check would only result in a small run-time cost, while failing to identify a potential buffer overflow may compromise the  security of the system. Thus, while it is adequate to use simple techniques to optimize range checks, sophisticated analyses, such as tracking the  values of pointers across procedures, are needed to get high-quality results in error detection tools.\n<h3>Memory-Management Tools</h3>\nGarbage collection is another excellent example of the tradeoff between efficiency and a combination of ease of programming and software reliability. Automatic memory management obliterates all memory-management errors (e.g., \"memory leaks\"), which are a major source of problems in C and C++ programs. Various tools have been developed to help programmers find memory management errors. For example, Purify is a widely used tool that dynamically catches memory management errors as they occur.
