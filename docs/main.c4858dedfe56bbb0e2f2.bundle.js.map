Memory hierarchies are a response to the basic limitation that we can build very fast storage or very large storage, but not storage that is both fast and large.\n      <h3>Parallelism</h3>\nAll modern microprocessors exploit instruction-level parallelism.

Programs are written as if all instructions were executed in sequence; the hardware dynamically checks for dependencies in the sequential instruction stream and issues them in parallel when possible. In some cases, the machine includes a hardware scheduler that can change the instruction ordering to increase the parallelism in the program.

Correspondingly, the speed of accesses between adjacent levels of the hierarchy can differ by two or three orders of magnitude. The performance of a system is often limited not by the speed of the processor but by the performance of the memory subsystem. While compilers traditionally focus on optimizing the processor execution, more emphasis is now placed on making the memory hierarchy more effective.\n\nUsing registers effectively is probably the single most important problem in optimizing a program.

We typically need to simulate many possible design alternatives on many different input sets, and each experiment may take days to complete on a high-performance machine.

Of special importance are techniques that detect statically when a program might have a security vulnerability.\n<h3>Type Checking</h3>\nType checking is an effective and well-established technique to catch inconsistencies in programs. It can be used to catch errors, for example, where an operation is applied to the wrong type of object, or if parameters passed to a procedure do not match the signature of the procedure. Program analysis can go beyond finding type errors by analyzing the flow of data through a program. For example, if a pointer is assigned null and then immediately dereferenced. the program is clearly in error.\nThe same technology can be used to catch a variety of security holes, in which an attacker supplies a string or other data that is used carelessly by the program. A user-supplied string can be labeled with a type \"dangerous.\" If\nthis string is not checked for proper format, then it remains \"dangerous\", and if a string of this type is able to influence the control-flow of the     \ncode at some point in the program, then there is a potential security flaw.\n<h3>Bounds Checking<</h3>\nIt is easier to make mistakes when programming in a lower-level language than a higher-level one. For example, many security breaches in systems are caused by buffer overflows in programs written in C. Because C does not have array bounds checks, it is up to the user to ensure that the arrays are not accessed out of bounds. Failing to check that the data supplied by the user can overflow a buffer, the program may be tricked into storing user data outside of the buffer. An attacker can manipulate the input data that causes the program to misbehave and compromise the security of the system. Techniques have been developed to find buffer overflows in programs, but with limited success.\n<br />Had the program been written in a safe language that includes automatic range checking, this problem would not have occurred. The same data-flow analysis  that  is used  to  eliminate  redundant  range  checks  can  also  be used to locate buffer overflows. The major difference, however, is that failing to elimate a range check would only result in a small run-time cost, while failing to identify a potential buffer overflow may compromise the  security of the system. Thus, while it is adequate to use simple techniques to optimize range checks, sophisticated analyses, such as tracking the  values of pointers across procedures, are needed to get high-quality results in error detection tools.\n<h3>Memory-Management Tools</h3>\nGarbage collection is another excellent example of the tradeoff between efficiency and a combination of ease of programming and software reliability. Automatic memory management obliterates all memory-management errors (e.g., \"memory leaks\"), which are a major source of problems in C and C++ programs. Various tools have been developed to help programmers find memory management errors. For example, Purify is a widely used tool that dynamically catches memory management errors as they occur.
